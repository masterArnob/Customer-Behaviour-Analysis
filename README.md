## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes **customer shopping behaviour** using transactional data from nearly **4,000 purchases** across various product categories.  
The objective is to uncover insights into:

- Purchase patterns  
- Customer segmentation  
- Product and category performance  
- Gender- and age-based spending  
- Revenue optimization opportunities  

The findings guide **data-driven business decisions** to improve marketing, customer engagement, and sales strategy.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)

- ✅ Handled missing data  
- ✅ Renamed and standardized columns  
- ✅ Feature engineering for better grouping and aggregation  
- ✅ Ensured data type consistency

## 📊 Data Analysis (SQL)

SQL was used to analyze cleaned data stored in a relational database.  
Key insights were derived through **structured queries** such as:

### 🔹 Q1: Product Performance
```sql
WITH sales_data AS(
    SELECT item_purchased AS product_name,
           SUM(purchase_amount) AS current_sales
    FROM customer
    GROUP BY item_purchased
)
SELECT product_name, current_sales,
       (SELECT AVG(current_sales) FROM sales_data) AS average_sales,
       current_sales - (SELECT AVG(current_sales) FROM sales_data) AS sales_difference,
       CASE
           WHEN current_sales - (SELECT AVG(current_sales) FROM sales_data) > 0 THEN 'Profit'
           WHEN current_sales - (SELECT AVG(current_sales) FROM sales_data) < 0 THEN 'Loss'
           ELSE 'Average'
       END AS performance
FROM sales_data;
```

### 🔹 Q2: Category Performance
```sql
WITH sales_data AS(
    SELECT category, SUM(purchase_amount) AS sales
    FROM customer
    GROUP BY category
)
SELECT category, sales,
       CONCAT(ROUND((CAST(sales AS FLOAT) / (SELECT SUM(purchase_amount) FROM customer))*100, 2), '%') AS sale_percent
FROM sales_data;
```

### 🔹 Additional Queries
| Query | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| Q3 | Total revenue generated by male vs. female customers |
| Q4 | Customers who used discounts but spent more than average |
| Q5 | Top 5 products with highest average review rating |
| Q6 | Comparison of average purchase amounts between shipping types |
| Q7 | Spending comparison between subscribed vs. non-subscribed customers |
| Q8 | Products with highest discount usage percentage |
| Q9 | Segment customers into VIP, Regular, and New |
| Q10 | Top 3 most purchased products per category |
| Q11 | Correlation between previous purchases and subscription likelihood |
| Q12 | Revenue contribution by age group |

## 📈 Key Findings

- 🏆 **Top-performing products** significantly exceeded average sales.  
- 💰 **Female customers** contributed slightly more to total revenue.  
- 🚀 **Subscribed customers** spent more frequently and had higher lifetime value.  
- 🛒 **VIP customers** (10+ previous purchases) generated the largest revenue share.  
- 📦 **Express shipping** correlated with higher purchase amounts.

## 🧠 Insights Summary

| Area | Key Takeaway |
|------|---------------|
| Product | Certain products outperform the average sales benchmark significantly. |
| Customer Segments | VIP customers provide the highest lifetime value. |
| Discounts | Discounts drive sales volume but not always higher revenue. |
| Gender | Female customers slightly outspend male customers overall. |
| Shipping | Express shipping customers spend more on average. |
